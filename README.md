Attention!

I don't really know why but CloudFront which have been created automatically didn't work. (E2QCXRVX7X05FM) I noticed that "Origin acces" was public and "Origin domain" had slight diggerence with real (s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com instead s3.EU-WEST-1.amazonaws.com). So I changed them manualy and then everything worked correct. I'd be happy if you could explain the reason.
